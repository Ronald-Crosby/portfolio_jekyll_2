Growing up, the web could be quite ugly. The 00â€™s saw massive growth in internet-based entertainment and the birth of social networking but pages were cluttered, text was small, forms were innavigable and the dominance of skeuomorphism made interfaces feel heavy and exhausting to operate. With that in mind, I am drawn to front-end development as a means to build a clear, well-designed web that makes services accessible for a heteronomous cohort of users.
