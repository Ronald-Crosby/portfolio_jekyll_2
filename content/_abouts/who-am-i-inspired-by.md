As someone who has never had a ‘formal’ training in programming, I am inspired by the educators who have made my transition from the humanities into technology possible, especially creative education startup SuperHi and free online resources such as FreeCodeCamp.

When it comes to development approaches, I have recently become interested in the intersection of user experience and web accessibility. Smashing Magazine’s recent focus on accessible forms has been a regular source of inspiration on how to tackle a notoriously difficult area of front-end development. I’m also intrigued by Andy Bell and Heydon Pickering’s programmatic (and opinionated) approach in their book Every Layout and have been attempting to implement some of these snippets in my own work.
