My name is Olly Robinson, and Iâ€™m a Front-end Developer with experience contracting for leading digital agencies in the UK. Having previously worked in the events industry I began self-teaching in 2019 and soon found an aptitude for translating designs into responsive, interactive websites and web apps.
