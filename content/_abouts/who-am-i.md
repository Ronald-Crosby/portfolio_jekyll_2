My name is Olly Robinson, and I’m a Front-end Developer based in London. I have worked in Front-end development for just over a year now, but I don’t come from a computing or even a STEM background. I studied English Literature at university and taught myself to code with a little help from [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/).
